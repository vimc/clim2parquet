_clim2parquet_ is a small Python package for internal use at [RESIDE-IC](https://reside-ic.github.io/) to convert prepared climate time-series data into Parquet files in support of climate-informed infectious disease modelling for [VIMC](https://www.vaccineimpact.org/).

## Installation

_clim2parquet_ can be installed from GitHub using a Python package manager.

```sh
pip install clim2parquet@git+https://github.com/vimc/clim2parquet
```

## Quick start

_clim2parquet_ is intended to be used internally with access to climate data generated at Imperial College.
With access to this data, you can convert country-specific climate data time-series by GADM admin level into Parquet files.

```python
import clim2parquet

# get available data sources
clim2parquet.get_data_names()

# with `dir_from` as your country-specific climate data source
# for GADM admin level 1 (largest sub-national unit)
clim2parquet.clim_to_parquet(
    data_source="CHIRPS", dir_from=dir_from, dir_to=".", admin_level=1
)

# converting multiple data sources and admin levels at once
clim2parquet.clim_to_parquet(
    data_source=["CHIRPS", "PERSIANN"], dir_from=dir_from,
    dir_to=".", admin_level=[0, 1]
)
```

You can generate a directory-specific index of administrative units to help identify output data and link it to other covariates using the function `make_admin_unit_ids`.
This function is used automatically from within `clim_to_parquet` if no index file is present in the data directory.

We currently support finding and converting the following climate data sources:

- CHIRPS
- ERA5 mean temperature
- ERA5 maximum temperature
- ERA5 minimum temperature
- ERA5 relative humidity
- ERA5 specific humidity
- PERSIANN

## Package data

This package includes some data accessible via a package function. To generate the raw data file read and provided by this function, run the scripts in `data-raw`. The recommended way of doing this is using the [`uv` package manager](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

```sh
# to prepare data on climate data sources
uv run data-raw/data_sources.py
```
